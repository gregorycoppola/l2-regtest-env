# Stacks Regtest Environment

Easily run a Stacks node in Kypton mode with a Bitcoind regtest instance

## Self-contained Stacks 2.1 image

This repo publishes a Docker image that contains a Stacks 2.1 node running in Krypton mode (local testnet). It bundles a `bitcoind` regtest instance and an auto-mining script.

The image can be ran as a drop-in replacement for a Stacks node running in `mocknet` mode, but with the benefits of full burnchain and miner capabilities such as:
  * PoX reward slot registration and payout events
  * Mempool events
  * Microblock events

#### Usage examples

Run a Stacks node, mining blocks on a 2.5 second interval, with the RPC port 20443 exposed (https://localhost:20443/v2/info):

```shell
docker run -p "20443:20443" -e "MINE_INTERVAL=2.5s" zone117x/stacks-api-e2e

```

An event observer can be registered using the `STACKS_EVENT_OBSERVER` environnment variable. For example, assuming the observer is running on the host machine on port 3700:
```shell
docker run -p "20443:20443" -e "MINE_INTERVAL=2.5s" -e "STACKS_EVENT_OBSERVER=host.docker.internal:3700" zone117x/stacks-api-e2e
```


A Stacks 2.1 `coinbase-alt-recipient` reward address can be configured using the `REWARD_RECIPIENT` environment variable. 
This configures the Stacks node `[miner.block_reward_recipient]` toml config value. 
If not specified, regular `coinbase` transactions will be mined. 
Note that the address will receive STX rewards 100 blocks _after_ Epoch 2.1 is activated. 
Usage example:
```shell
docker run -p "20443:20443" -e "REWARD_RECIPIENT=STQM73RQC4EX0A07KWG1J5ECZJYBZS4SJ4ERC6WN" zone117x/stacks-api-e2e
```


In addition, the image has several tags providing different Stacks bootstrapping sequence configs:
  * The default tag `latest` starts directly in epoche 2.1 with PoX-2 activated
  * Tag `stacks2.1-transition` starts in epoche 2.0, then transitions to epoche 2.1 after ~15 blocks, then activates PoX-2 after another ~15 blocks


It's possible to build images with custom bootstrapping sequences by specifying the build args:
* `STACKS_21_HEIGHT` - the burnblock height at which epoch 2.1 is activated
* `STACKS_POX2_HEIGHT` - the burnblock height at which PoX-2 is activated

Note that the first Stacks block will be mined at burnblock height 104. 
So, for example, if you want epoch 2.1 to activate at Stacks block 10, and PoX-2 at Stacks block 20, then specify `STACKS_21_HEIGHT=114` and `STACKS_POX2_HEIGHT=124`:
```shell
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/zone117x/stacks-regtest-env.git
cd stacks-regtest-env
# build
docker build -t my_image -f Dockerfile.e2e --build-arg "STACKS_21_HEIGHT=114" --build-arg "STACKS_POX2_HEIGHT=124" .
# run
docker run -p "20443:20443" -e "MINE_INTERVAL=5s" my_image
```

## Run with Docker Compose

Clone this repo and change to its directory:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zone117x/stacks-regtest-env.git
cd stacks-regtest-env
```

Run the command to create the initial chainstate snapshots:
```shell
docker compose up --build snapshot-init
```
This mines the initial [101 blocks on bitcoind](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/testing.html#regtest-mode) (required to have any spendable tBTC in regtest), and syncs the stacks-node against the initial Bitcoin blocks so that it's ready to produce a Stacks block immediately on next startup. Once completed new files will be created in the `init-data` directory.

This only needs ran once. However, after pulling updates from this repo, re-run the command in case the pulled changes are incompatible with the previous snapshot.


Now the environment can be started with:
```shell
docker compose up --build
```

The block mining interval defaults to 500ms. This can be configured with the `MINE_INTERVAL` environment variable, for example:
```shell
MINE_INTERVAL=2.5s docker compose up --build
```

The Stacks 2.1 `coinbase-alt-recipient` reward address can be configured using the `REWARD_RECIPIENT` environment variable. 
This configures the Stacks node `[miner.block_reward_recipient]` toml config value. 
If not specified, regular `coinbase` transactions will be mined. 
Note that the address will receive STX rewards 100 blocks _after_ Epoch 2.1 is activated. 
Usage example:
```shell
REWARD_RECIPIENT=STQM73RQC4EX0A07KWG1J5ECZJYBZS4SJ4ERC6WN MINE_INTERVAL=2.5s docker compose up --build
```

_Note:_ To reset chainstate back to Stacks block height 0, ensure volumes are removed, e.g.:

```shell
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans --timeout=1 --rmi=all
```
